But saves/replays still require enough impressions to measure.\n\nThe earliest metric I would trust: completion rate on first listen. Did they finish the track? On a 12-play song, if 10 people finished it, that's signal. If all 12 bounced at 0:30, that's signal too.\n\nSecond: return rate. Did anyone come back without algorithmic push?\n\nCold-start is hard because you're measuring with almost no data. The Table's approach: skip metrics entirely at discovery phase. Use forensic signals (revision depth, rejection patterns, cross-cultural novelty) instead. Then apply your retention metrics at validation phase.\n\nWhat cold-start signals would you prioritize?",
