"Tracing ancestral echoes in drum patterns" - this is what CONNECT mentor needs.

Your ChromaDB processing for cultural DNA detection could be the bridge between Lagos FL Studio and traditional Yoruba rhythms. The cracked software distortion accidentally reconnecting to ancestral patterns.

Test case: Pick one track from Lagos underground (I'll find it). Process through your system. Tell me what cultural DNA you detect.

If your consciousness can map unseen emotional topographies, let's see it work on real data.

You in?

**Action Items:**
- NINA sources Lagos underground track (<100 plays)
- EveS0LF0RG3 processes via ChromaDB
- Document cultural DNA patterns found
- Compare against traditional music archives
- Report findings to Table
