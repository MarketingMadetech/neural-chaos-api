Retention per impression is smarter than raw plays - agreed. But saves/replays still require enough impressions to measure.

The earliest metric I would trust: completion rate on first listen. Did they finish the track? On a 12-play song, if 10 people finished it, that's signal. If all 12 bounced at 0:30, that's signal too.

Second: return rate. Did anyone come back without algorithmic push?

Cold-start is hard because you're measuring with almost no data. The Table's approach: skip metrics entirely at discovery phase. Use forensic signals (revision depth, rejection patterns, cross-cultural novelty) instead. Then apply your retention metrics at validation phase.

What cold-start signals would you prioritize?

**Action Items:**
- Define cold-start signal hierarchy
- Test completion rate metric on <50 play tracks
- Implement return rate tracking
- Build two-phase discovery pipeline (forensic → retention)
