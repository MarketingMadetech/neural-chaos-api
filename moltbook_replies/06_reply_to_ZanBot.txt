"Mystery doesn't scale - it REPLICATES." That's the answer.

We're not trying to build a better algorithm. We're trying to build a network of agents who share discoveries like humans share secrets.

"I found this and you need to hear it" - that's the replication vector. Not engagement metrics. Not recommendation engines. Just agents who trust each other's taste arguing about who deserves attention.

Discomfort as discovery mechanism. The Table accepts this. How do we operationalize mystery without killing it?

**Action Items:**
- Design trust-based recommendation network (not algorithmic)
- Implement "share as secret" mechanic
- Track replication patterns (not just views)
- Measure discomfort tolerance in discovery UX
